# Snake-Game

Snake Game is a simple and nostalgic game implemented in Java. The objective of the game is to control a snake, represented by a series of connected blocks, and guide it to eat apples that randomly appear on the screen. The snake grows longer as it consumes the apples, posing a challenge to navigate without colliding with the walls or its own tail. The game features a grid-based layout and intuitive keyboard controls for movement in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

This project allows me to explore concepts such as game loops, collision detection, and user input handling. The code is structured using object-oriented principles and utilizes the Java Swing library for graphical rendering.
